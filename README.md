# Wrangle and Analyze Dog Tweets Data
A data wrangling project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity

The project's goal is to gather, assess and clean data from various data sources, and perform analyses and visualizations using the final cleansed master data set. The data were cleaned and analyzed using standard Python libraries and methods, in a Jupyter Notebook. Afterwards, two reports were created to document the data wrangling efforts and to share findings. 

__The project contains:__
- wrangle_act.ipynb - a Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing of the data
- wrangle_act.html - an html file generated from wrangle_act.ipynb
- wrangle_report.pdf - report documenting the data wrangling steps
- act_report.pdf - report commenting the gained insights and data visualizations
- figures (folder) - png of the data visualizations
- twitter-archive-enhanced.csv - the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, as provided by Udacity
- image-predictions.tsv - the image predictions from a neural network model working with the dogs' images, as provided by Udacity
- tweet_json.txt - the additional tweet data (retweet count, favorite count) obtained from the Twitter API
- twitter_archive_master.csv - the master dataset combining the Twitter archive data, additional tweet data and image predictions data
